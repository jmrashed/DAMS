        The proposed project is a smart appointment booking system that provides patients or any user an easy  
        way of booking a doctor's appointment online. This is a web based application that overcomes the 
        issue  of managing and booking appointments according to user's choice or demands. The task sometimes 
        becomes very tedious for the compounder or doctor himself in manually allotting appointments for the
        users as per their availability. Hence this project offers an effective solution where users can
        view various booking slots available and select the preferred date and time. The already booked 
        space will be marked yellow and will not be available for anyone else for the specified time. This
        system also allows users to cancel their booking anytime. </p>

        Patient Appointment Reservation System (PARS) deals with problems related to patient visit
        reservation in health care institutions.<br>These can be divided as follows:<br><br>
    <ul> 
        <li> Much personal time spent when registering for a visit and while waiting at consulting rooms;</li>
        <li> Limited selection possibilities for patients;</li>
        <li> Inefficient use of human resources in doctors care;</li>
        <li> Inefficient management of doctors care  due to inadequate flows of information.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
